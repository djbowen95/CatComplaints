To break down the brief, I need to:

- [] Set up a single web page
- [] Have a header and footer
- [] Have an image with a caption
- [] Have a contact form
- [] Have a 'polished' UI

- [] Use Semantic HTML
- [] Make sure I use universal, element and class selectors
- [] Must use three colours
- [] Must use one font / font family
- [] Must have at least two different heading elements
- [] Header must be fixed to the top of the page
- [] Nav bar must have three links
- [] One of those links must be 'contact'
- [] Contact form must have input for 'name' and 'email'
- [] Must include a send button
- [] Must include alt text for the image
- [] Bonus: have anchor links change the cursor
- [] Deploy to GitHub pages

3. I then want to go through and make sure I have an example of:
- Box model, positioning, selectors, fonts, semantic html
As these were the topics covered in the first week of the bootcamp.

4. I want to produce a simple write-up, if I can, of what I learned in the first week of the coding bootcamp, and summarising the core concepts.

5. I'm going to be going over my fundamental JavaScript, DOM manipulation and jQuery soon - so I might return to this to have the form submit.
