# Landing Page
This is a simple HTML page built to a brief, the first mini-project for the University of Birmingham/2U Coding Bootcamp. You can find [the brief here](./docs/BRIEF.md).

I built this project locally during the bootcamp but am building it again here to remind myself of some basic HTML, and to have it on GitHub for reference. Please take a look at [my profile](https://github.com/djbowen95) for more complex examples of my work.
